## Purpose

Mathster is a product designed for blind algebra/geometry students who face challenges with concepts such as graphs, shapes, and equations. Users can navigate the website with their voice and receive audio output as guidance and as feedback for their math questions.

### Features

Mathster provides text feedback as audio output for the following subjects: 
- Graphs
- Geometry
- Algebra


## Get Started

Mathster is built and deployed using Render and Netlify. To host locally, the folder [tools](/tools) provides bash scripts that include the commands to be ran to host both the backend and frontend. The repository should then be hosted on localhost:5000
